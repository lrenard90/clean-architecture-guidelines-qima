# Clean Architecture Guidelines

## Project Overview

This project aims to provide comprehensive guidelines and resources for implementing **Clean Architecture** and **Hexagonal Architecture** (also known as Ports and Adapters) principles in software development.

## Objectives

### 1. Educational Resource

This project serves as an educational resource that:

- **Explains core principles**: Clearly articulates the fundamental principles of Clean Architecture and Hexagonal Architecture
- **Provides concrete examples**: Includes practical, real-world examples demonstrating how to apply these architectural patterns
- **Illustrates best practices**: Shows how to structure code, organize layers, and manage dependencies according to these principles

### 2. AI-Assisted Development Guidelines

This project defines guidelines specifically designed for AI agents to:

- **Implement new projects**: Provide clear instructions and patterns for AI to follow when creating new codebases that adhere to Clean Architecture principles
- **Migrate existing codebases**: Offer structured approaches and strategies for AI to help refactor and migrate legacy code toward Clean Architecture patterns
- **Maintain consistency**: Ensure that AI-generated code follows established architectural patterns and maintains separation of concerns

## Target Audience

- **Developers**: Software engineers looking to understand and implement Clean Architecture in their projects
- **AI Agents**: Automated systems that need clear, structured guidelines for generating code that follows architectural best practices
- **Architects**: Technical leaders who want to establish architectural standards for their teams

## Structure

This repository is organized to provide:

- **Principles documentation**: Core concepts and theoretical foundations
- **Implementation patterns**: Reusable patterns and templates
- **Code examples**: Practical examples in various programming languages
- **Migration guides**: Step-by-step approaches for refactoring existing code
- **AI guidelines**: Specific instructions formatted for AI agent consumption

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Whether you're adding examples, improving documentation, or refining AI guidelines, your input helps make this resource more valuable for the entire community.
